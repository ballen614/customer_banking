# OSU AI Bootcamp - Challenge 3 - Customer Banking
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
The task was to create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.
## Files
- Account.py is a class that tracks the customer account balance and overall interest earned.
- cd_account.py is a library that interacts with Account.py to input customer parameters and calculate the new balance and interest earned.
- savings_account.py is the same as cd_account.py, like, almost identical.  I assumed the interest calculations would be different or something, but no difference was identified in the challenge parameters.
- customer_banking.py is the main code locatio, where the main() function is called.
